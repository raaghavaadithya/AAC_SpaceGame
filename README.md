# AAC GameDev Project - PITSTOP
This project is to practice game development in Unity by creating a Racing Game.

The game is set in a martian environment.

Here are some of the features of the game:

* The car can be controlled using the standard WASD keys
* 2 laps must be completed to complete the 'level'
* A lap timer shows the time passed since the start, while a Best Lap Timer keeps track of the fastest time across all maps
* It has 3 different maps to be played on, and the user can either select to play the deault map or choose the track of their choice
